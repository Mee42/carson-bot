# carson-bot
a bot made for just general commands
written in java, using Discord4J
I'm still learning Java, so my code isn't the greatest.... 

Commands are sorted into Command objects implementing ICommand and registered in their respective subregisters

Feel free to write a command or two, but I want to write all the main code myself. If you have recommendations, post them in `Issues` or contact me via discord (below)
